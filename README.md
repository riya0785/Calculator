# Collaborative Menu-Driven Modular Calculator

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project implements a **collaborative, menu-driven modular calculator**.  
The calculator supports **basic arithmetic operations** such as:

- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division
- Exponentiation

The calculator is **designed to be extended easily**, so other collaborators can add new functionalities without modifying the core logic. New operations can be **registered dynamically** using a simple function.

---

## ðŸš€ Key Features
- **Modular Design**: Each operation is a separate function.
- **Dynamic Registration**: Operations are stored in a dictionary, allowing collaborators to register new functions without changing the main code.
- **Menu-Driven Interface**: Users can select operations from a simple, numbered menu.
- **Safe Division Handling**: Division by zero is handled gracefully.
- **Extensible**: Additional operations (like modulus, square root, etc.) can be easily added.

## ðŸ§© Usage
1. Run the program.
2. Select a mathematical operation from the menu.
3. Enter two numbers when prompted.
4. View the result.
5. Select `6` to exit the calculator.
